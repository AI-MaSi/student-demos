# Masi Control System for Students

This is a simplified example of a Masi control system, designed for students to learn how to use Masi-project systems. It's built around a simplified Raspberry Pi stack for control and sensor reading.

### Nice to know:
You'll probably are doing the project with Raspberry Pi5. The Pi5 does not support the old RPi.GPIO library, so please use e.g. lgpio instead. You can install it with:
'''bash
pip install rpi-lgpio
   ```
